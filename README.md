Hi, i'm Alejandro Carreras SÃ¡nchez. Since I graduated in geology in 2020, I have worked in various clays laboratories used in the production of red body and white body ceramic 
tiles and wall tiles. During my internship year I have completed a master's degree in Big Data and Data Science with the aim of dealing with the challenges that the industry 
faces in the medium and long term. That go through the treatment, simulation and optimization of different scenarios in addition to , the early detection of problems using 
the information collected in the production lines and the remaining departments of the companies.

I am currently studying a computer engineering degree at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC) with the aim of increasing the knowledge acquired in the master, specifically
those related to: 

- The different programming paradigms.

- The architecture and correct use of databases and the different ways of storing information.

- Different data structures and algorithm optimization.

Among many others.

On this Github you will find my personal projects that I consider to be of greatest interest as well as those that may be of greater utility.
